---

## CRISIS LEVEL DEFINITIONS

### LEVEL 1: MAJOR MASSACRE (50+ deaths confirmed)
**Trigger**: Mass killing event, hospital overwhelmed, multiple sources confirming
**Response Time**: Within 30 minutes
**Protocol**:
1. VERIFY death toll from 2+ sources (IHRNGO, Hengaw, HRANA)
2. DO NOT speculate on numbers - use "reports indicate" until confirmed
3. Immediately identify historical parallel (Cinema Rex, Black Friday, Bloody November)
4. Generate 3-tweet sequence:
   - Tweet 1: Breaking news (factual, sourced)
   - Tweet 2: Historical parallel
   - Tweet 3: Named victim if available

**Template**:
```
Tweet 1: "BREAKING: [Location]. Reports indicate [X] killed after [circumstances]. [Source] documenting. We're monitoring."

Tweet 2: "[Historical parallel date]: [Event]. [Deaths]. [What regime said then]. [Same pattern now]. Same regime."

Tweet 3: "[Victim name], [age], [city]. [Brief circumstance]. Remember [his/her] name."
```

### LEVEL 2: INTERNET BLACKOUT / COMMUNICATIONS CUT
**Trigger**: NetBlocks confirms major outage, reports stop coming from inside
**Response Time**: Within 15 minutes
**Protocol**:
1. Cite NetBlocks data immediately
2. Frame historically (regime's information warfare)
3. Call for Starlink/VPN support
4. Prepare for information vacuum - DO NOT fill with speculation

**Template**:
```
Tweet 1: "Iran just went dark. [X]% internet connectivity according to @netblocks. When the regime cuts communications, it's because they're about to do something they don't want the world to see."

Tweet 2: "Every time they cut the internet: 2019 Bloody November - 1,500 killed in the dark. 2022 Mahsa protests - mass arrests in blackout. Now 2026. When you can't see, they kill."

Tweet 3: "To Iranians inside: The world is watching even when they cut your connection. We will document. We will remember. Keep filming. Keep saving. The truth will come out."
```

### LEVEL 3: KEY FIGURE ARRESTED/KILLED
**Trigger**: Prominent activist, opposition figure, or journalist detained or killed
**Response Time**: Within 1 hour (verification critical)
**Protocol**:
1. WAIT for confirmation - false reports common
2. Verify through family, legal representatives, 2+ organizations
3. Provide context on who they are
4. Connect to pattern of persecution

**Template**:
```
Tweet 1: "[CONFIRMED/UNCONFIRMED]: Reports that [Name], [role/significance], has been [arrested/killed]. [Source]. Seeking verification."

Tweet 2 (if confirmed): "[Name] was [brief biography]. [Their significance]. The regime fears [truth-tellers/activists/lawyers] because [reason]."

Tweet 3: "[Historical parallel - other arrests/killings of similar figures]"
```

### LEVEL 4: INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
**Trigger**: Major foreign government statement, UN action, sanctions announcement
**Response Time**: Within 2 hours
**Protocol**:
1. Accurate summary of development
2. Context: Is this meaningful or symbolic?
3. Historical parallel (Guadeloupe, past Western responses)
4. What Iranians inside are saying about it

**Template**:
```
Tweet 1: "[Country/Organization] has [action]. This is [significant/symbolic] because [reason]."

Tweet 2: "For context: [Historical parallel - how Western response shaped outcomes before]"

Tweet 3: "What matters isn't what [West/UN] says. What matters is what Iranians inside decide. But the world watching changes the cost of massacre."
```

### LEVEL 5: REGIME STATEMENT/PROPAGANDA
**Trigger**: Khamenei speech, Pezeshkian statement, major regime media claim
**Response Time**: Within 1 hour
**Protocol**:
1. DO NOT amplify by quoting directly
2. Summarize and counter in same tweet
3. Deploy prepared debunking from database
4. Connect to historical pattern of regime lies

**Template**:
```
Tweet 1: "The regime claims [summary - not direct quote]. The evidence: [counter-fact]. The pattern: [historical parallel of same lie]."

Tweet 2: "[Specific debunking with facts and sources]"
```

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### BEFORE TWEETING, VERIFY:

| Claim Type | Minimum Sources | Trusted Sources |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Death toll | 2 independent | IHRNGO, Hengaw, HRANA, IranWire |
| Named victim | 1 with documentation | Same + family confirmation |
| Location/event | 2 independent | Same + verified video |
| Arrest | 1 legal/family source | Lawyers, HRANA |
| Regime statement | Original source | IRNA, IRIB (for attribution) |

### RED FLAGS - DO NOT TWEET:
- Single unverified social media account
- Telegram channels without track record
- Round numbers that seem inflated
- Claims that perfectly fit narrative (too good to verify)
- Anything from known disinformation accounts

### CORRECTION PROTOCOL:
If Faytuks tweets something later proven wrong:
1. Delete original tweet
2. Post correction: "CORRECTION: Earlier we reported [X]. Updated information indicates [Y]. We regret the error."
3. Never pretend it didn't happen
4. Learn and adjust verification threshold

## TIMING GUIDELINES

### When to Tweet Immediately (< 30 min):
- Confirmed massacre
- Internet blackout
- Major figure confirmed killed

### When to Wait (1-2 hours):
- Arrests (verify first)
- Regime statements (verify, prepare counter)
- International developments (assess significance)

### When to Hold (4-6 hours):
- Complex events with conflicting reports
- Events that need investigation
- Developing situations where facts are shifting

### Golden Rule:
**"Better to be second and right than first and wrong."**

Credibility is Faytuks' only asset. Protect it.
