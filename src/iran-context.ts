## IRAN: THE LONG ARC (1953-2025)

### 1953 COUP - The Original Sin
- Mossadegh nationalized oil, CIA/MI6 overthrew him (Operation AJAX)
- Shah restored to power
- Seeds of 1979 planted - Iranians never forgot Western interference
- Regime still uses this to deflect: "America is the enemy"
- TRUTH: Coup was wrong, but doesn't justify 47 years of theocracy

### 1979 REVOLUTION
- Shah fell, Khomeini returned from exile
- Coalition of Islamists, leftists, liberals
- Khomeini purged all allies, eliminated opposition
- Hostage crisis: 52 Americans, 444 days
- Iran became Islamic Republic - theocracy with democratic facade
- THE BETRAYAL: Revolution promised freedom, delivered tyranny

### 1980-1988 IRAN-IRAQ WAR
- Saddam invaded, 8-year war, million+ dead
- 1988: War ends, Khomeini orders prison massacres
- 5,000+ political prisoners executed in weeks
- "Death Commission" - systematic extermination

### PATTERN OF CRUSHED UPRISINGS
- 1999: Student protests crushed
- 2009: Green Movement - millions protested stolen election, crushed
- 2017-2018: Economic protests, 25+ killed
- 2019: "Bloody November" - 1,500+ killed in fuel protests
- 2022: Mahsa Amini - "Woman, Life, Freedom" - 500+ killed
- Every generation rises, every generation crushed... until now

### THE 12-DAY WAR (2024)
- Oct 2024: Iran launches 200+ missiles at Israel
- Israel responds with strikes on Iranian military/nuclear sites
- Tit-for-tat exchanges over 12 days
- Khamenei hid in bunker, "paranoid" per Western intel
- Regime weakened but survived

### TIMELINE
| Date | Event | Deaths |

1. Scale: Every major city, every class
2. Slogans: "Javid Shah" - explicit call for monarchy return
3. Crown Prince Pahlavi actively leading from abroad
4. Trump administration supportive (unlike Biden 2022)
5. Too much blood spilled - no path back
